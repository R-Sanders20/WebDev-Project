                <h1>Childhood</h1>
                <p>
                    I was born on the 7th October 1993 around 09:00am to my father David Sanders and mother Julie Sanders. <br>
                    I have an older brother and sister, Tom and Gayle, and a family dog Teke, an ex-RAF german shephard.<br><br>
                    I was an outgoing child, playing with the neighbourhood children almost every day during the summer, <br>
                    up until my early teenage years, when the xbox 360 came into my life, at this point I became an indoor child, <br>
                    glued to my console, becoming obsessed with games, at this point Halo 3 and Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.

                <h1>
                    Teenage Years
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately during my teenage years, my parents began to split, begining with arguments and eventually my father moving out,<br>
                     followed by divorce procedings, however the divorce was cancelled following a suspected heart attack from my father. <br>
                     These happening affected me but not to the fullest extent that I was aware of until my adulthood<br>
                      (these happenings would be one of the reasons I struggle to remember my childhood, alongside my grandfathers passing).
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my school education, I came to the conclusion that I wished to join the RAF as a Weapons System Operator (crewman). <br>
                    Unfortunately I did not get the grades in physics required to serve this role. Seeking alternatives into military service, I attended <br>
                    college and completed a Uniformed Public Service level 3 Diploma in the hopes of joining the army as a Weapons System Engineer.<br>
                    Alas, these aspirations will also not come to fluision, first I was declined due to deppression being on my medical records, <br>
                    this needed to be sorted and have no relaps for two years, I was on my way and proud of myself, until I suffered a back injury, <br>
                    slipping a disc in my lower back. I then learned that once someone suffers a back injury, the military will not accept them.

                <p>
                    Following the military blow, I needed a job until I could figure out what to do for a career.<br>
                    I got a job at Hollywood Bowl, and thouroughly enjoyed managing and repairing machines in the arcade, <br>
                    however when things took a turn for the worst with management changes, I decided it was time to leave.<br>
                    I got a job working traffic management at Southmead hospital and decided I wished to be a security officer, <br>
                    gaining the qualification relevant to the career, I was instantly taken on as part of the security personel at <br>
                    Southmead Hospital where I was thrown into the deepend, and I swam. I had a new career and looked forward to<br> 
                    going to work, with aspirations to get a close protection qualification.

                <h1>Late twenties</h1>
                <p>
                    After changing security jobs several times, I eventually had an accident and was hit off my motorcycle in November of 2018.<br>
                    Not sure what to do with myself, with my career over, I decided to go back to college, I finished and went into higher<br>
                    education at Bath Spa univerity in 2020 starting a combined degree of Education and History. After getting to the end of my <br>
                    second year I discovered why I was struggling in this degree, whilst also finding out about a quality that is not common amongst <br>
                    the general public.<br>
                    <br>
                    After scoring 99 percentile on my Perseptual reasoning during my education psychologist meeting, I promptly changed my degree to Creative Computing (Gaming)<br>
                    where I am much happier, and I am getting much higher marks in my modules all round, and once again, look forward to my future.

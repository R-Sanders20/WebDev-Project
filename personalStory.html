                <h1>Childhood</h1>
                <p>
                    Ryan was born on the 7th October 1993 around 09:00am to his father David Sanders and his mother Julie Sanders. <br>
                    He has an older brother and sister, Tom and Gayle, and a family dog Teke, an ex-RAF german shephard.<br><br>
                    He was an outgoing child, playing with the neighbourhood children almost every day during the summer, <br>
                    up until his early teenage years, when the xbox 360 came into his life, at this point he became an indoor child, <br>
                    glued to his console, becoming obsessed with games, at this point Halo 3 and Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.

                <h1>
                    Teenage Years
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately during his teenage years Ryan's parents began to split, begining with arguments and eventually his father moving out,<br>
                     followed by divorce procedings, however the divorce was cancelled following a suspected heart attack from his father. <br>
                     These happening affected Ryan but not to the fullest extent that he was aware of until his adulthood<br>
                      (these happenings wood be one of the reasons he struggles to remember his childhood, alongside his grandfathers passing).
                </p>
                <p>
                    During his school education Ryan came to the conclusion that he wished to join the RAF as a Weapons System Operator (crewman). <br>
                    Unfortunately he did not get the grades in physics required to serve this role. Seeking alternatives into military service, he attended <br>
                    college and completed a Uniformed Public Service level 3 course in the hopes of joining the army as a Weapons Syste Engineer.<br>
                    Alas, these aspirations will also not come to fluision, first he was declined due to deppression being on his medical record, <br>
                    this needed to be sorted and have no relaps for two years, he was on his way and proud of himself, until he suffered a back injury, <br>
                    slipping a disc in his lower back. He then learned that once someone suffers a back injury, the military will not accept them.

                <p>
                    Following the military blow, Ryan needed a job until he could figure out what to do for a career.<br>
                    He got a job at Hollywood Bowl, and thouroughly enjoyed managing and repairing machines in the arcade, <br>
                    however when things took a turn for the worst with management changes, he decided it was time to leave.<br>
                    He got a job working traffic management at Southmead hospital and decided he wished to be a security officer, <br>
                    gaining the qualification relevant to the career, he was instantly taken on as part of the security personel at <br>
                    Southmead Hospital where he was thrown into the deepend, and he swam. Ryan had a new career and looked forward to<br> 
                    going to work, with aspirations to get a close protection qualification.

                    the general public.<br>
                    <br>

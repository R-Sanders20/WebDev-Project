                I am 29, and have a daughter called Elizabeth. I am not sure what I wish to do in my future following
                the
                completion of my degree. I do have a contact at Laika who has already tried to recruit me for the
                animation
                studio, and have talked to someone at GCHQ who has also tried to convince me to look into working with
                them.
                However neither of these are official propositions, however it has given me a glimps of what could be in
                my
                future.

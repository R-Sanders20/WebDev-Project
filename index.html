        I am a first year creative computing student, although this is my third year at university.

    <p class="Main">
        I am 29, and have a daughter called Elizabeth. I am not sure what I wish to do in my future following the
        completion of my degree. I do have a contact at Laika who has already tried to recruit me for the animation
        studio, and have talked to someone at GCHQ who has also tried to convince me to look into working with them.
        However neither of these are official propositions, however it has given me a glimps of what could be in my
        future.

        Please look through the portfolio I have created.

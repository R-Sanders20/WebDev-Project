        Merlin came from an abusive house hold that had 4 children who were never appropriately told no, he struggles
        with daily issues and is incredibly skittish, he was kicked out of his previous house when they got a new
        kitten.
        When he moved into my previous household he never truly felt at home, hardly ever coming into the house. When I
        recently moved into my new flat, Merlin came with me, he has made great strides since moving here with me, and
        is not the cat he used to be.

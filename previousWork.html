            <br>
            When Ryan was sent to a session for help with study, he was informed that his issues could
            be related to underlying mental disabilities, he was therefore sent to do some
            tests, followed by an education psychologist meeting; here he discovered he has
            Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, and some symptoms of ADHD. This news explained a lot for Ryan,

        <h1>Higher Education Journey</h1>

        <p class="PreText">
            Ryan has been in education a long time, having finished college in 2012, he went to
            work, and in 2019 returned to college and is now in his third year of higher
            education at Bath Spa university.<br>
            <br>
            Having originally attending university studying a combined degree of History and Education;
            although he was getting through this degree, he was managing to get PASS's and only
            just a getting MERIT at times.<br>
            <br>
            When Ryan was sent to a session for help with study, he was informed that his issues could
            be related to underlying mental disabilities, he was therefore sent to do some
            tests, followed by an education psychologist meeting; here he discovered he has
            Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, and some symptoms of ADHD. This news explained a lot for Ryan,
            he was also informed he has tallents that are not normal, which he always thought
            were part of everybodies natural brain functionality.<br>
            <br>
            With this newly aquired knowledge, Ryan saught after a new degree and future, and
            immdeiately applied for a degree in Creative Computing, gaming pathway.
        </p>

        <h1>Creative Computing Journey</h1>

        <p class="PreText">During his first year in his new degree, Ryan discovered new passion for his work, although
            difficult at times, he considered it a challenge and he accepted it.<br>
            <br>
            What follows is examples of Ryans work, which he has previously done, with some
            explanations on how he has used these works to not only advance his education further,
            but to aid his persoanl wellbeing.

                    <p>In the colourisation assessment we were instructed to use colour on a still image to bring
                        forward certain aspects and draw attention in ceetain areas. <br>I therefor decided to do this
                        image and highlight my father as he is one of the people in my life I look up to the most.</p>

                    </video>
                    <p>In the stop motion animation assessment, the topic chosen for us to highlight was difference.
                        what difference that is was up to us.<br> I chose to use a difference in myself from normal
                        people and chose to highlight some characteristics of ADHD. The finished product was jumpier
                        than i wished it to be, however it was too late in the process of creating the stop motion that
                        i realised it was jumpy.<br><br>The entire stop motion sequence was hand drawn, that background
                        being used as a treadmill where the beginning matches the end, restarting the background again.

                    <p>The bitsy game brief was simple, create a bitsy game that took a minimum of 2-4 minutes when
                        taking the most direct route, other then that everything was up to us.</p>
                    <p>Again, drawing from past and current events in my life at the time, I decided to use the game to
                        draw attention to something called "self-abandonment", having realised I had been suffering from
                        it and was in the proocess of resolving it, i not only used this game to spread awareness, but
                        to also help myself overcome this issue.</p>

                    <p>The assessment brief for the non-linear story was to create an interactive story that engaged the
                        user in some fashion.</p>
                    <p>I decided to use differentiating ending or outcomes depending on what the person does within the
                        story, and at the same time, testing their moral compass, and question their own actions in the
                        scenario.</p>
